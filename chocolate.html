<a name="history"><h2>Where does chocolate come from?</h2></a>
<img src="images/chocolate drink.jpg" alt="">
<br/>
<p>
The history of chocolate begins in Mesoamerica. 
Fermented beverages made from chocolate date back to 350 BC.
The Aztecs believed that cacao seeds were the gift of Quetzalcoatl, 
the god of wisdom, and the seeds once had so much value that they were used as a form of currency. 
Originally prepared only as a drink, chocolate was served as a bitter, from a liquid, 
mixed with spices or corn puree. It was believed to have aphrodisiac powers and to give the drinker strength.
<br/>
<br/>
After its arrival to Europe in the sixteenth century, 
sugar was added to it and it became popular throughout society, 
first among the ruling classes and then among the common people. 
<br/>
<br/>
In the 20th century, chocolate was considered essential in the rations of United States soldiers at war.
<br/>
<br/>
chocolate manufacturers and artisans share their passion with the consumers, 
creating new products to satisfy their evolving tastes and requirements. 
Chocolate continues to cross the frontiers.

<br/>
<p>This brief guide to the types of chocolate will demystify 
the many different chocolate names, 
and help you choose the perfect type of chocolate for your recipe.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Cocoa powder:</b> This unsweetened powder is pulverized, 
partially defatted chocolate liquor. 
Natural cocoa powder is light brown, 
with a strong, pronounced chocolate flavor. 
It is slightly acidic, so it is best to use natural cocoa powder 
in recipes calling for baking soda.
<br/><br/>
<b>Unsweetened chocolate:</b> Also known as “bitter” or “baking” chocolate. This is pure chocolate liquor, composed solely of ground cocoa beans. Although it looks and smells like chocolate, it has a bitter taste and is not meant for consumption on its own
<br/><br/>
<b>Dark chocolate: </b>Chocolate that contains chocolate liquor, sugar, cocoa butter, vanilla and lecithin (an emulsifier).There are no milk solids added to dark chocolate.The cocoa content of commercial dark chocolate bars can range from 30 percent (sweet dark) to 70 to 80 percent for extremely dark bars. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Milk chocolate: </b>In addition to containing cocoa butter and chocolate liquor, milk chocolate contains either condensed milk (most European varieties) or dry milk solids.
<br/><br/>
<b>White chocolate: </b>White chocolate gets its name from the cocoa butter it contains, but does not contain chocolate liquor or any other cocoa products. As a result, it has no pronounced chocolate taste but commonly tastes like vanilla or other added flavorings.
<br/><br/>
<b>Couverture chocolate: </b>Used primarily by professional bakers or confectioners, this chocolate contains a very high percent (at least 30 percent) of cocoa butter, as well as a high percentage of chocolate liquor. 
<br/><br/>
<b>Gianduja chocolate: </b>Gianduja is the name given to a European style of chocolate made from chocolate and nut paste. Hazelnut paste is most common, but gianduja can also be made with almond paste.
<br/><br/>
<b>"Candy coating" chocolate: </b>Also known as “confectionery coating,” “summer coating,” or “compound coating.” These terms refer to candy products that are flavored with dark, milk or white chocolate and substitute vegetable or palm oils for cocoa butter. These products are cheaper than most chocolates, and do not contain significant amounts of chocolate liquor; thus, they do not have a strong chocolate flavor or an appealing mouthfeel.
